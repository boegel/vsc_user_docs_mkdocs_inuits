*[cluster]: A group of compute nodes.
*[compute-node]: The computational units on which batch or interactive jobs are processed. A compute node is pretty much comparable to a single personal computer. It contains one or more sockets, each holding a single CPU. Some nodes also contain one or more GPGPUs. The compute node is equipped with memory (RAM) that is accessible by all its CPUs.
*[core]: An individual compute unit inside a CPU. A CPU typically contains one or more cores.
*[HPC]: High Performance Computing, high performance computing and multiple-task computing on a supercomputer.
